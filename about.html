  <p>
    We are the ACM Student Chapter of Northeastern University's College
    of Computer and Information Science. The Association for Computing
    Machinery, or ACM, was founded in 1947 as the world's first scientific
    and educational computing society.

  <p>
    Northeastern's Student Chapter offers a variety of ways for you to
    get involved. Activities of our chapter include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Speaker Series: Each week, we bring in a variety of speakers from
      both corporate and academic environments to broaden the insight
      and professional experience of our members. The talks take place
      during Activities Period, so your classes won't get in the way.
      Check out our calendar to see when the next Speaker is coming to NU!

    <li>
      Social events to promote friendship and camaraderie among CCIS
      students and faculty, including "Geek Week," barbecues, and
      student/faculty dinners.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lastly, we are a voice for the students of Northeastern University's
      College of Computer and Information Science. If you have any questions
      or comments about how something works, we will do our best to explain
      what you need to do to make your mark in our community.
