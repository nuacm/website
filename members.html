        Anyone can become a nuACM member! To become an official member
        of nuACM, we ask for a yearly membership due of $10.
    </p>
    <p>
        Membership entitles you to a nuACM T-Shirt, (please request upon
        paying your dues), and access to our Library! There may also be
        some contests only for paying members. You'll also be listed on
        our website.

    <h3>Want to join or renew your membership?</h3>

        You can come to any ACM event and give your dues to the Treasurer
        for the  school year, and they will take your information and give
        you a receipt.  You will soon see yourself on this site and have
        access to all of the wonderful resources we have available for you!
    </p>
    <h3>Think you're already a member?</h3>

        Your membership expires each school year.  Each year you must pay
        your dues to be a member. Membership dues are $10.
